# My Portfolio - Oscar Vitela
This portfolio is created with the help of Shaq Portfolio Template from the following link, special thanks to him for being the original designer of the site:

https://github.com/shaqdeff/Portfolio-Template/

From this template I added some feature changes to suit the site more to my needs, adding a language translation to have site in both English and spanish using i18n for React js, I also changed the site to have multiple pages and show my projects separately.
